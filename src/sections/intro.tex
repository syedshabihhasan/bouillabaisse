\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Looking at three questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item how well does our dataset comply with balance theory, and weak balance theory?
\begin{itemize}
\item consider as a whole, undirected-static
\item temporal, undirected-bimonthly
\end{itemize}
\item how well does it comply with theories dealing with directed data
\begin{itemize}
\item consider as a whole, directed-static -- probably something like status theory
\item temportal, directed-day/week/month/bimonthly ??
\end{itemize}
\item can we have a better framework to explain our data?
\end{itemize}

The paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:related} introduces the related work. 
We describe the dataset in detail in Section \ref{sec:dataset}. 
Our analysis on the structural properties is elucidated in Section \ref{sec:analysis}. 
Finally, we conclude in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
